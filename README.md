#Boutparse

this is a utility that scrapes [flattrackstats.com](http://flattrackstats.com)'s bout and team data for use in other projects.

Specifically, I am using the data as a baseline dataset for a "roller derby bouts near you" site, using the locations of the teams and their bout data to determine bouts within x miles of a given location.
